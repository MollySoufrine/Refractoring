The classes added for each of these I.D's seemed like extra work and unnecessary. We can use the ID's to style each of these in CSS instead of the class.-->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

    <div class="benefits">
        <!--I removed the individual classes for each h3, that enclosed it's img and P tag as well, because they were all styled the same. So to clean it up I styled them all under the benefits class and then benefits h3 or p depending on the specific styles for those properties.-->
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="https://uconn.bootcampcontent.com/university-of-connecticut/conn-stmf-fsf-pt-05-2020-u-c/raw/d3be9d87257958eeeca98a6404e5f4cd6e5bcfac/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Homework/Develop/assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="a funnel with an arrow pointing down to a dollar sign"/>
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.

            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
