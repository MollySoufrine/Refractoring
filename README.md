# refractoring

For this repository, I took a pre-made html and css file and cleaned it up.

I took an html and css file that had been written for a marketing company and rearranged, organized, as well as took out unnecessary items. In the HTML file there were extra div classes that were not needed, a disconnected link, as well as incomplete image sources that were also missing alts. One example is, there was a class called header around the header tag, this was on of the classes I chose to eliminate.

In the css file I rearranged styles under their apropriate class. I also saw that multiple I'D's and classes had the same style attribute so for those I listed them and assigned them their properties. This way it creates a more organized code to navigate incase someone wanted to see how some things were done or wanted to make more changes.

I used VS Code to refractor these files and sources such as w3schools, csstricks as well google.
